Botania's passive mob shedding without Botania (shrug).

Original code copied from Botania, a mod by Vazkii, with the shedding code attributed to SoundLogic.
Alterations by YeOldeSoupe consist of stripping the handlers down to shedding functionality alone, and wrapping them in a similarly bare mod registration.

Botania's github is [here](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania).
Botania's license is [here](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).
Copylefting is obnoxious so through the power of laziness this claims the following as its license: [here](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).
